## 🌐 Browser Compatibility

This project uses **CSS animations** and `backdrop-filter` for glassmorphism.  
For best results, view in modern browsers like **Chrome**, **Edge**, or **Safari**.  
If you want broader browser support:
- Use vendor prefixes for animations (e.g., `-webkit-`).
- Provide fallback background colors for older browsers.
